Section B

1. Explain the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript.

let : block scoped, and can be redeclared within the same scope. 

const: used to assign a variable that cannot be redeclared/reassigned, block scoped and must be assigned a value at the time of declaration.

var: block scoped and cannot be redeclared within the same scope.


2. What are JavaScript objects, and how are they different from arrays?
Javascript objects are a collection of key-value pairs and can hold any data type and functions, are unordered while arrays are ordered lists of elements and used for storing similar data.

3. Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
== also called loose equality operator compares values and can perform coercion.
=== is a strick equality operator that checks for both the data type and value.

4. What is an event in JavaScript? Provide an example of how to handle a button
click event.
An event is something that happens to a HTML element in the browser for example when a button is clicked.
Demo: The following code, when the button with id 'btn' is clicked, it alerts "Hello" in the browser.
  <button id= 'btn' onclick='alert("Hello")'>Click Me</button>


5. Describe the forEach and map methods in JavaScript. How are they similar, and
how do they differ?

Similarity: Both are used to iterate over arrays and take a callback function which runs on each element.

Difference: forEach executes but does not return a new array.
            map: executes and returns a new array
